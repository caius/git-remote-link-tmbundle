Helper to generate links for local files against the upstream remote repository on popular git hosting services. (ie, get a link to the current file/line on github/gitlab/etc.) Had the idea for months, inspired to actually cut code by &lt;a href="https://github.com/sshaw/git-link"&gt;git-link&lt;/a&gt; for emacs.
&lt;/p&gt;
