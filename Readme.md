# Git Remote Link

Helper to generate links for local files against the upstream remote repository on popular git hosting services. (ie, get a link to the current file/line on github/gitlab/etc.)

Had the idea a while back, inspired to actually cut code by [git-link](https://github.com/sshaw/git-link) for emacs.
